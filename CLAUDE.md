# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive D&D Quest Board web application built with ASP.NET Core 8 MVC following a clean architecture pattern. The application provides a complete solution for D&D campaign management including user authentication, quest creation, calendar scheduling, player coordination, and email notifications. It features a layered architecture with domain, repository, and service layers following SOLID principles and dependency injection patterns.

## Development Environment

**Important**: This project is developed in a WSL Ubuntu environment, but SQL Server runs on the Windows host machine. When running the application locally, it connects to SQL Server on the Windows host.

## Development Commands

### From Root Directory (using solution)
```bash
# Build the entire solution
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run --project QuestBoard.Service

# Restore packages for solution
dotnet restore
```

### From QuestBoard.Service Directory
```bash
# Run the application
dotnet run

# Build the application  
dotnet build

# Restore packages
dotnet restore

# Update database (if adding migrations)
dotnet ef database update

# Create Entity Framework migrations (run from Service project)
dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName --project ../QuestBoard.Repository
```

### Connection String Notes
- **Development**: Uses `localhost` to connect to SQL Server running on Windows host from WSL
- **Docker**: Uses `sqlserver` service name for container-to-container communication

### Docker Development (from root directory)
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose (includes SQL Server)
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f questboard

# Stop containers
docker-compose down
```

## Project Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with three main layers:

### Project Structure
- **QuestBoard.Domain**: Contains business models, enums, and core domain logic
- **QuestBoard.Repository**: Data access layer with Entity Framework Core, repositories, and AutoMapper profiles
- **QuestBoard.Service**: MVC web application with controllers, views, services, and view models

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core 8 MVC with Repository Pattern
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server with Entity Framework Core
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 + vanilla JavaScript with D&D theming
- **Email**: .NET SMTP with Gmail integration
- **Mapping**: AutoMapper for entity-to-model mapping
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization

### Core Domain Models (QuestBoard.Domain)
- `Quest`: Main quest entity with title, description, difficulty, DM info, and scheduling
- `User`: User account management with authentication and profile information
- `ProposedDate`: Date options for each quest with voting capabilities
- `PlayerSignup`: Player registration for quests with user association
- `PlayerDateVote`: Player votes on proposed dates (Yes/No/Maybe)
- `Difficulty`: Enum for quest difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, Deadly)
- `VoteType`: Enum for player vote types (Yes, No, Maybe)

### Domain Services (QuestBoard.Domain/Services)
- `QuestService`: Business logic for quest management and coordination
- `UserService`: User account management and authentication logic
- `PlayerSignupService`: Player registration and quest participation logic
- `EmailService`: Email notification service with Gmail SMTP integration
- `BaseService`: Abstract base class providing common service functionality

### Domain Configuration
- `SecurityConfiguration`: Centralized security settings and authentication configuration

## Development Notes

### Frontend Features
- Uses Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI with custom CSS for difficulty badges
- JavaScript handles dynamic form elements (adding/removing date options)
- Auto-refresh on quest detail pages every 30 seconds
- Color-coded difficulty system (Easy=green, Medium=yellow, Hard=red, Deadly=purple)

- DM registration form with validation and themed styling
- Responsive table layout for DM directory

### Business Logic
- Complete user account system with registration and authentication
- DM registration system with name and optional email
- Quest creation with DM selection and multiple proposed dates
- First-come-first-served player selection with configurable maximum
- Comprehensive date voting system with Yes/No/Maybe options
- Automatic date recommendation based on most "Yes" votes
- Role-based authorization for DM operations
- Calendar integration for quest scheduling and visualization
- Email notifications sent only to selected players when quest is finalized
- Session management for maintaining user state and preferences

### Architecture Patterns
- Clean Architecture with domain-driven design principles
- Repository pattern with generic base implementation and dependency injection
- AutoMapper for clean separation between entities, domain models, and view models
- MVC pattern with strongly-typed view models for form binding and data transfer
- Service layer pattern for business logic (QuestService, UserService, EmailService)
- Custom authorization patterns with handlers and requirements
- Dependency injection throughout all layers for loose coupling
- Entity Framework Core with code-first approach and migrations
- Clean separation of concerns across three distinct projects

## Entity Framework Guidelines

### Package Management
- **IMPORTANT**: Entity Framework packages should ONLY be added to the Repository project
- Never add EF packages (like Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design) to the Service project
- The Repository project contains all EF-related dependencies and database context

### Migration Commands
```bash
# Install EF tools globally (if not already installed)
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

# Create a new migration (run from Service project directory)
cd QuestBoard.Service
dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName --project ../QuestBoard.Repository

# Apply migrations to database
dotnet ef database update --project ../QuestBoard.Repository

# Remove the last migration (if needed)
dotnet ef migrations remove --project ../QuestBoard.Repository
```

### Automatic Migration Application
- The application automatically applies pending migrations on startup
- This is handled in `ServiceExtensions.ConfigureDatabase()` using `context.Database.Migrate()`
- No manual database update commands needed - just run the application after creating migrations
- This ensures the database schema is always up to date in development environments

### Migration Troubleshooting
If you encounter "table already exists" errors when switching from EnsureCreated to migrations:

1. **For development**: Delete the `quests.db` file and restart the application
2. **For clean migration setup**: 
   ```bash
   # Remove current migrations
   dotnet ef migrations remove --project ../QuestBoard.Repository
   
   # Create initial migration (from current schema)
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate --project ../QuestBoard.Repository
   
   # Delete database and restart app to apply migrations cleanly
   ```
3. The `ConfigureDatabase()` method includes fallback handling for existing databases

## UI/UX Design Guidelines

### Modern Card Styling
- **IMPORTANT**: All new views should use the modern card styling pattern for consistency
- Use `modern-card` class for the main card container
- Use `modern-card-header` class for card headers with consistent styling
- Use `modern-card-body` class for card body content
- Card headers should include an icon and title using this pattern:
  ```html
  <div class="card-header modern-card-header">
      <h2 class="mb-0">
          <i class="fas fa-icon-name text-color me-2"></i>
          Page Title
      </h2>
  </div>
  ```
- Always include a horizontal rule (`<hr>`) before the button section
- Use consistent button styling with icons:
  ```html
  <div class="d-flex justify-content-between">
      <a href="..." class="btn btn-secondary">
          <i class="fas fa-arrow-left me-2"></i>
          Cancel/Back
      </a>
      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">
          <i class="fas fa-save me-2"></i>
          Action Text
      </button>
  </div>
  ```

### Button Guidelines
- Always use filled in colored buttons instead of outline only
- Include FontAwesome icons with `me-2` spacing class
- Use semantic colors (primary, secondary, success, danger, warning)
- Maintain consistent button layout with `d-flex justify-content-between`
